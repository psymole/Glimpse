[ The below explicit exemption, we hope, clears up the Glimpse
  developers' position concerning an ambiguity with the GNU General
  Public License concerning what constitutes a 'mere aggregation'
  versus a combined or derived work.  The intention is to make it
  clear that arbitrarily-licensed programs such as Glimpse plug-ins do
  not automatically assume the GNU General Public License (GPL)
  themselves simply because of their invocation of (or by) procedures
  implemented in GPL-licensed code, via libglimpse or a similar interface
  to methods provided by the pdb: ]

* If you create a program which invokes (or provides) methods within
  (or for) the GPL Glimpse application core through the medium of libglimpse
  or another implementation of the 'procedural database' (pdb) serial
  protocol, then the Glimpse developers' position is that this is a 'mere
  aggregation' of the program invoking the method and the program
  implementing the method as per section 2 of the GNU General Public
  License.

* 'libglimpse' and the other Glimpse libraries are licensed under the
  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE -- see the 'COPYING' file in the
  libglimpse directory for details.
